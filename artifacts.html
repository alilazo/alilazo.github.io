				<h3 class="w3-justify w3-col m6">Last semester we were suggested to start a handshake account which I took the opportunity and did. Here is my handshake 
					account which is up-to-date and includes my skills and past volunteer experience. It was really simple to make and did not take a lot of time out of my day. I find myself updating it every
				now and then because it is where I get the most job recommendations.

				<h3 class="w3-justify w3-col m6">A couple weeks ago, I got invited to judge a science fair for 6-12 graders. I was mainly a judge for the biomedical science field which was an honor
					 due to the fact that I picked who went to state. Valero energy has always been in my family for a while and I plan on doing computer work with them in the future hopefully so there for this will
					  help me in the future.

			<img class="w3-col m6 w3-round w3-border w3-padding" src="./Pictures/artifacts/Capture.PNG" style="max-width: 30%; height: auto;">
				<h3 class="w3-justify w3-col m6">Three weeks ago which was 3/25, I had to make an appointment with my academic advisor about my schedual because I did not know what classes to take since I am a junior.
					It turns out that my classes in high school did not relate to my degree that I am going for which is Computer Science and I have to take all 3 years like everyone else. I am a freshman but can take junior classes
					and qualify as a junior, it is confusing but the way Crystal Trevino explained it made sense to me. We then proceeded to make my schedual which will work great with me!

				<h3 class="w3-justify w3-col m6">There was a first year presentation for all students where anyone could join and show off cool things they have learned in their first year class. By joining and watching this session, 
					there were a lot of neat presentations from art to body positivity to computer science. My favorite out of all of them was the body positivity presentation because there was a lot of inspiring words that the girl said. 
					One of the first year computer science teams also got to present and got rewarded by doing so and their presentation was phenomenal, everyone in the chat was astonished by their game presentation. I wish my team had applied to 
					this opportunity but I did not want to do something they would not want to do.
